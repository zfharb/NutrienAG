# The internet is broken

We're trying to test https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/ but, it's going horribly. Goodness gracious, barely any tests are green. Please help us by doing the following:

1. Unzip this repo.
2. Create a new GitHub repo.
3. Push this repo in its broken state to your new repo.
4. Fix as much as you can.
5. Make any changes you feel would make this better.
6. Make a PR against the original.
7. Send us the PR link for review.

## Node JS

The recommended node version is v20.19.3 or v18.20.8
We recommend using nvm to install and manage node versions. It can be found at https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.

## Running Tests

Run tests with `npm run wdio` or `npm run wdio-headless`

Run specific tests with `npm run wdio -- --cucumberOpts.tagExpression="@TAG"`

#### You are our only hope.
